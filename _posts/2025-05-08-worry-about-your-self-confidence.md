## Worry about your self-confidence? Read this book.

_The way I see “confidence” has changed ever since_

### Prologue
I often go to bookstores just for window shopping. Even without any intention to buy, sometimes I ended up bringing the book to the cashier when I found an interesting book. To decide whether I should buy it or not, I usually look at 3 things:
- Topic
- Review
- Price

The topic should be interesting enough for me. The closer the proximity of me to the topic, the higher the chance for me to bring it to the cashier.

Good online reviews from some platforms also help me to roughly assess whether it is worth it to spend the money on a book.

Lastly, the price. In Jakarta, imported books are not cheap. And there are some cases when I prefer to buy the original imported books rather than the translation, if any. So, discount comes to the rescue!

I considered myself a person with low self-confidence. Any kind of book that talks about improving self-confidence will easily interest me, including this Perfectly Confident book by Don Moore.

Once I got interested in this book, I started to look at its online reviews. Overall, the reviews at ["Amazon"]("https://www.amazon.com/Perfectly-Confident-Calibrate-Decisions-Wisely/dp/0062887750"), ["Goodreads"]("https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49946989-perfectly-confident"), and ["Blinkist"]("https://www.blinkist.com/en/books/perfectly-confident-en") show a pretty good rating.

I was so glad that when I found this book, it was half the original price. As the discounted price became more affordable for me, I decided to buy this nice yellow book.

### Underconfidence

Due to my low self-confidence, I missed a lot of opportunities and lost happiness. According to this book,
> _Too little confidence is a recipe for self-doubt, inaction, and (as the self-help books will tell you) missing out on an awesome life._ (p. 27)

Don Moore tells us that one of the reasons we put ourselves below other people is because we know well about our weaknesses, but we are not sure about the others’ abilities.

In this case, a person with underconfidence like me will be more focused on my inability to do something rather than my strength. I tend to dwell on my ineptitude and blame myself for the past mistakes I made. This is made worse by the widespread use of social media, where people most likely show their successes and achievements.

Don Moore reminds us not to criticize ourselves too much. Just because we made a mistake, we don’t have to label ourselves as a failure. Our life doesn’t end just because we made a wrong decision.

> _Self-flagellation is unlikely to help you, unlikely to facilitate future success, and unlikely to elicit sympathy from others._ (p. 207)

In reality, **no one is perfect**. I have my strengths and weaknesses, so do you. So do other people.

Did you see your friends’ posts about their latest achievements? You might be thinking that your friends’ success story is running smoothly. You just couldn’t see their pain and inner doubts during the process. You didn’t know the mistakes they have made in their journey. You were not able to notice their weaknesses behind it.

So, how do we fix this underconfidence? Don Moore tells this rule of thumb on how to calibrate the confidence:

> _For confidence to be well calibrated, it must be matched by underlying facts, evidence, and competence._ (p. 32)

In this situation, we have to know our position relative to other people. To know our position, we can start by knowing ourselves better. There are many ways to do this, and I suggest writing down our **strengths** and weaknesses. Yes, I’m putting a bold over that ‘strengths’ word because this is something you already have, but maybe you weren’t aware of it.

If we face difficulties knowing ourselves, we can always ask a close friend. We can consult a psychologist if needed. Sometimes, the point of view of another person will help us a lot to know ourselves better.

When we have done this, we will have gathered the facts and evidence from our side. Having good self-knowledge is a good start for us to be a better person. That way, we can see ourselves as not always being beneath others. Yes, there will be some points where someone is better than us, but there will also be some other points where we are better than others.

Because, again, nobody is perfect.

### Overconfidence

Another problem with me, who is underconfident, is: by how much should I improve my confidence? After reading this book, I realized that having too much confidence can be problematic.

![alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/0*7lDz0yR9ivarVu7V "Photo by Adeolu Eletu on Unsplash")

Some tragedies around the world have been attributed to overconfidence. The sinking of the Titanic, the Chernobyl disaster, and the Challenger explosion are some examples.

In his book, Dan Moore cited Daniel Kahneman, the author of _Thinking, Fast and Slow_. Kahneman wrote that **overconfidence is “the most significant of the cognitive biases.”**

People with overconfidence often put forward their intuition and judgment. While this will not always give a bad result, intuitive human judgment is prone to biases and errors.

> _The problem with intuition is that because it results from unconscious processes, you cannot audit it._ (p. 23)

Oftentimes, overconfident people take high risks beyond their capacity. Their lack of experience and competence drives them to the wrong judgment. This leads to their failure, disappointing themselves and the people around them.

Remember the rule of thumb I mentioned earlier? Calibrated confidence must be based on **facts**, **evidence**, and **competence**. When overconfidence comes to you, you might unconsciously put aside these factors.

This doesn’t mean someone with overconfidence will not look at the data at all. Yet their belief makes them reckless and incautious. The 2008 financial crisis, explained in this book, is one of the examples.

In a nutshell, the 2008 financial crisis happened mainly because U.S. banks gave many mortgage loans to high-risk borrowers, who couldn’t afford them in the first place. As the number of loans increased, so did the housing prices.

When a huge number of mortgage defaults occurred, banks seized the houses and tried hard to sell them. The house supply rose significantly, while the demand dropped. Housing prices crashed, causing many banks and lenders to lose massive amounts of money and even go bankrupt.

Did the banks look at the data? Yes, they did. They sure had risk models to run their business. But the banks that were severely impacted by the crisis tended to be overly confident in their existing model, while the market had undergone a significant change. By the time they updated the model, it was too late.

### Confidence and Success

So, why can we find so many success stories with the credit to confidence?

Don Moore tells us about correlation and causation:

> _But correlation is not causation. Just because two things are associated with one another does not mean one causes the other._ (p. 93)

We need to distinguish between correlation and causation. According to [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/blog/causation-correlation), correlation is when two variables appear to change in sync. On the other hand, causation is when a variable directly impacts another variable.

Let’s say we are in sunny weather. As the temperature rises, more people want to eat ice cream, leading to a rise in ice cream sales. At the same time, the cases of sunburn also increase during sunny weather.

![alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/0*_vvd6g0Rbu-wRvw7 "Example of causation and correlation. From Amplitude")

While ice cream sales and cases of sunburn increase at the same time, it doesn’t mean that eating ice cream causes sunburn, and vice versa. This is an example of _correlation_.

Besides, the relation between sunny weather and a rise in ice cream sales is what we call _causation_. The same goes for sunny weather and sunburn cases.

Now, let’s get back to the confidence topic. Let’s say there is an athlete who trained very hard every day. One day, he confidently joined a competition and won a medal.

His intensive training built his skills. When he reaches a certain level of competence, it leads him to win. This is a _causation_.

On the other hand, competence might bring up confidence. While it’s not always the case, a person with good skills tends to have better confidence.

But this doesn’t mean that being confident alone causes a win.

Imagine that the athlete had rarely trained before the competition. He would be overconfident if he thought that he would get the medal.

> Confidence alone cannot increase our competency.

Based on this, the relationship between his confidence and his winning is a _correlation_, not causation.

Back to this question: why can we find so many success stories with the credit to confidence?

Because they are truly competent. As they have enough competency, they show their confidence. Meanwhile, we can’t always witness their efforts when they are building their competence. Their confidence is what we can see.

> _Your confidence is evident for all to see. Invisible are the many hours you have invested in training and practice._ (p. 94)

### Perfectly Confident

Stay between underconfidence and overconfidence, and you will have a well-calibrated confidence. To find the balance, we need to practice based on guided methods.

![alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/0*Q4Pwzypv8FC3_7RY "Photo by Greg Rosenke on Unsplash")

Apart from explaining the cons of under- and overconfidence, in this book, Dan Moore encourages us to calculate and examine our beliefs and thoughts before making a decision. He also gives a lot of real-world examples to make it easier to understand. When we are more certain that our hypothesis is closer to the truth, we are on the right track to become confident.

There are some ways to test our opinion. One of them is as simple as considering the opposite. Thinking that you could be wrong will make you listen to other opinions, gather more facts and evidence you may miss, and finally lead you to reconsider whether you should keep or adjust your opinion.

> _“People who are right a lot seek to disconfirm their most profoundly held convictions, which is very unnatural for humans.”_ (p. 56–57)

During a meeting in an organization, I believe there are often cases where juniors are reluctant to give their views, especially when it’s against the senior’s opinion. To tackle this, you can start to read this book. 😄

This is just one example. There are many ways to evaluate our beliefs, which can be used depending on the case.

The reason for doing this is that we can be more sure of our opinion, backed by facts and evidence. Combined with our competence, we can be perfectly confident.

### Epilogue

I’m not a motivator, nor a professional in the self-development field. I just like to read, and I found that this book is interesting. It gives me a new point of view on how I see confidence in a better way.

This “more calculated confidence” would not only change my perspective when I’m doing my job, but also affect my social life and relationships positively.

Thank you for reading!
